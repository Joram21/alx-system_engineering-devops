1. Why is monitoring needed
Performance Optimization: Monitoring helps in optimizing system performance, identifying bottlenecks, and enhancing user experience.
Issue Detection: It detects problems before they lead to service outages, allowing for proactive resolution.
Resource Allocation: Monitoring assists in resource allocation, ensuring efficient usage and preventing overloading or underutilization.
Compliance and Security: Monitored systems help maintain security and compliance standards by detecting anomalies and vulnerabilities.

2. What are the 2 main area of monitoring
Performance Monitoring: Involves tracking metrics like CPU usage, memory, response times, and network performance.
Availability and Uptime Monitoring: Monitors service availability, downtimes, and overall system uptime.

3. What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
Definition: Access logs record every request made to a web server. They contain detailed information about who accessed the server, the time of access, the requested resource, the user's IP address, and more.
Usage: Access logs are vital for analyzing traffic patterns, identifying popular content, understanding user behavior, and investigating security issues.

4. What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
Definition: Error logs capture information about errors that occur within a web server, such as 404 (not found) errors, 500 (internal server error), and more.
Usage: Error logs help in identifying issues, debugging problems, troubleshooting errors, and addressing potential security threats or misconfigurations within the server.
