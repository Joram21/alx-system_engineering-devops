1. What Bash scripting should not be used for
Heavy Computation: Bash scripts are not suitable for computationally intensive tasks. They are not as efficient as languages like Python or C for numerical calculations or data processing.

Complex Applications: Writing complex software applications with user interfaces, databases, and advanced logic is not the ideal use case for Bash scripting. More high-level languages like Python, Java, or C# are better suited.

Cross-Platform Portability: Bash scripts are inherently tied to Unix-like systems. They may not be suitable for developing cross-platform applications.

Large-Scale Software Development: Large software projects with many contributors, complex architecture, and extensive libraries are generally not developed using Bash.

2. What is an API
API (Application Programming Interface): An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to communicate with a software component, service, or system.

3. What is a REST API
REST API (Representational State Transfer API): REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and follows the principles of statelessness and resource-based interactions. It is commonly used for web services.

4. What are microservices
Microservices is an architectural style where a complex application is broken down into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others via APIs.

5. What is the CSV format
CSV Format (Comma-Separated Values): CSV is a plain text format used to store tabular data (numbers and text) as plain text. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and columns within each row are separated by commas.

6. What is the JSON format
JSON Format (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used for data exchange between a server and a web application, as well as for configuration files.

7. Pythonic Naming Conventions:

Package and Module Name: lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., my_package)
Class Name: CapWords or CamelCase (e.g., MyClass)
Variable Name: lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., my_variable)
Function Name: lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., my_function)
Constant Name: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., MY_CONSTANT)

8. Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python: CapWords or CamelCase is a naming convention for class names in Python. It is used to make class names more readable and distinct from variable and function names. For example, it helps you differentiate between a class named MyClass and a variable named my_class. This convention enhances code clarity and is a standard practice in Python programming.
